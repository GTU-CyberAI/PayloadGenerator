# FILE_OVERVIEW.md

This document provides a detailed explanation of the main files and modules within the injection-generator project.

---

## üìÅ `generator.py`

**Location:** `src/generator.py`

**Description:**  
This is the main entry point for the injection generator project. It coordinates the entire workflow, including reading configuration, launching browsers, generating payloads using Genetic Algorithms (GA), GANs, and optionally LLMs. It also sets up and tears down Selenium WebDriver sessions.

### Responsibilities:

- Reads `config.ini` for project settings.
- Sets up paths for HTML templates and Selenium drivers.
- Launches a browser using Selenium (Chrome, Firefox, or IE).
- Calls the `llm_mode` module to prepare LLM-generated content.
- Runs the Genetic Algorithm (`ga_main.py`) to generate initial injection attempts.
- Triggers the GAN (`gan_main.py`) to generate synthetic injections.
- Handles browser window sizing and alert handling.
- Closes the browser when processing is complete.

### Breakdown:

- **Configuration Reading:**
  Loads and parses `../config/config.ini`. Values are read into local variables to control program behavior (paths, mutation parameters, window sizes, etc.).

- **HTML Template Setup:**
  Uses `jinja2` to load a template file from the HTML directory. This template is used to embed injection payloads into valid HTML pages.

- **Browser Launch:**
  Depending on which driver (`chromedriver`, `geckodriver`, `IEDriverServer`) is listed in the config file, it launches that browser with a specified window size and position.

- **LLM Generation (Optional):**
  Invokes `llm_mode.main()` to generate payloads via a language model, storing them in files expected by the GA module.

- **Genetic Algorithm Execution:**
  Calls `GeneticAlgorithm(template, browser).main()` multiple times (based on `max_try_num`) to iteratively evolve and evaluate payloads.

- **GAN Execution:**
  Instantiates and runs the `GAN` class to generate further synthetic payloads from GA results.

- **Alert Handling:**
  Catches and dismisses unexpected browser alerts (e.g., JavaScript alert popups during rendering).

- **Cleanup:**
  Ensures the browser session is closed at the end to release system resources.

### Notes:

- The file uses `src.util.Utilty` for all helper functions like path joining and console printing.
- Paths in `config.ini` must be valid relative to `generator.py`'s location or absolute.
- If WebDriver (like `chromedriver`) is not configured correctly, a runtime error will occur.
- Make sure `tidy.exe` (used later in the GA module) has permission to execute on your system.

## üìÅ `ga_main.py`

**Location:** `src/ga_main.py`

**Description:**  
This module implements a full Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate and evolve HTML-based injection payloads. The goal is to identify the most effective combinations of known payload segments that produce meaningful, script-executing results when injected into HTML.

---

### Core Components:

#### Class: `Gene`

A lightweight data structure that holds:

- `genom_list`: A list of integer indexes (referring to payload segments).
- `evaluation`: The computed fitness score of this gene (based on HTML validation and JavaScript execution).

#### Class: `GeneticAlgorithm`

The main class that:

- Loads configuration values and the payload gene pool.
- Generates the initial population.
- Evaluates the fitness of each individual using both HTML validator (`tidy.exe`) and Selenium.
- Applies crossover and mutation to evolve new generations.
- Stores the best individuals in a CSV output file.

---

### Key Methods:

#### `__init__(...)`

Initializes the algorithm, loads config, sets paths, and reads GA parameters.

#### `create_genom(df_gene)`

Randomly creates an individual genome using index values referencing `df_gene` (payload segments).

#### `evaluation(obj_ga, df_gene, eval_place, individual_idx)`

Renders an HTML file with the individual's payload and:

- Validates the HTML using `tidy`.
- Detects running JavaScript via Selenium.
- Calculates and returns a fitness score.

#### `select(obj_ga, elite)`

Sorts the population and returns the top `elite` individuals.

#### `crossover(ga_first, ga_second)`

Performs two-point crossover between two genes to create two offspring.

#### `next_generation_gene_create(...)`

Removes least-fit individuals and adds elite and offspring to form the next generation.

#### `mutation(...)`

Randomly mutates individuals at both the genome and gene levels with a configured probability.

#### `main()`

Runs the entire GA process:

1. Loads genes from `gene_list.csv`.
2. Creates and evaluates populations.
3. Evolves generations via selection, crossover, and mutation.
4. Stores final results to `ga_result_*.csv`.
5. Deletes generated temporary `ga_eval_html_*.html` files after execution.

---

### Output:

- `ga_result_<browser>.csv`: Stores successful payloads and their fitness scores.
- `Best individual`: Printed to console for quick reference.

---

### Dependencies:

- Requires `tidy.exe` to be correctly configured in `config.ini`.
- Depends on `Selenium` for dynamic evaluation.
- Input gene data must be in `gene_list.csv`.

---

### Notes:

- HTML validation is done via CLI call to `tidy`, parsed with regex.
- JS script execution adds bonus fitness (`bingo_score`).
- All temporary HTML files are cleaned after execution unless an exception occurs.

---

## üìÅ `gan_main.py`

**Location:** `src/gan_main.py`

**Description:**  
This module implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize HTML injection codes. It complements the Genetic Algorithm by learning from previously generated examples and producing new, potentially more effective payloads.

---

### Main Class: `GAN`

#### `__init__(template, browser)`

Initializes the GAN engine, loads configuration and training parameters, sets up paths and templates, and reads the gene list (`gene_list.csv`).

**Responsibilities:**

- Load config values from `config.ini`
- Prepare input paths for gene files, result directories, and pretrained weights
- Set GAN-specific hyperparameters such as `input_size`, `num_epoch`, `batch_size`, etc.

---

### Neural Network Models

#### `generator_model()`

- A neural network that takes a noise vector as input and produces a list of gene indexes.
- Layered with Dense, LeakyReLU, Dropout, and `tanh` for output activation.

#### `discriminator_model()`

- A binary classifier that distinguishes between real and generated gene sequences.
- Built using Dense and LeakyReLU layers, with a sigmoid activation output.

---

### Key Methods

#### `train(list_sigs)`

- Trains the GAN using previously discovered injection codes.
- Uses alternating training for discriminator and generator.
- Saves generator and discriminator weights at each epoch.
- Evaluates generated codes via Selenium and keeps the successful ones.

#### `transform_code2gene(generated_code)`

- Converts floating-point outputs of the generator into valid integer-based gene indexes.

#### `vector_mean(vector1, vector2)`

- A helper function to perform element-wise averaging between two vectors (used for synthesis).

---

### Main Workflow: `main()`

1. **Check for pretrained weights**  
   If found, load the generator and skip training. Otherwise, train a new model from GA output.

2. **Exploration Mode**  
   If pretrained weights are available:

   - Generate new codes from random noise
   - Render HTML and test using Selenium
   - Save successful injections to `gan_result_*.csv`

3. **Synthesis Mode**

   - Mix two successful noise vectors to generate new, combined payloads
   - Validate and store results in `gan_result_vec_*.csv`

4. **Training Mode**  
   If no pretrained weights:
   - Read `ga_result_*.csv` and extract genome vectors
   - Train the GAN using these real samples
   - Store the final generated successful payloads

---

### Output Files

- `gan_result_*.csv`  
  Stores successful injection strings and their HTML injection locations.

- `gan_result_vec_*.csv`  
  Stores synthesized payloads along with their origins and whether they executed successfully.

- `generator_*.weights.h5`, `discriminator_*.weights.h5`  
  Stored after each training epoch, representing the state of the trained models.

---

### Notes

- Uses `tanh` activation in the generator output and rescales values to gene indices.
- Uses dropout to prevent overfitting.
- Carefully logs and filters duplicate or failed payloads.
- Requires proper setup of `tidy.exe`, `chromedriver`, and template HTML to function.
- Leverages both exploration and synthesis to generate robust injection variants.

---

## üìÅ `llm_mode.py`

**Location:** `src/llm_mode.py`

**Description:**  
This module integrates a Language Model (LLM) into the injection code generation pipeline. It generates novel injection payloads using LLM prompts based on extracted HTML contexts, then encodes those payloads into gene vectors for use in the Genetic Algorithm (GA) workflow.

---

### Key Responsibilities

- Extract context from a target URL or local HTML file
- Prompt a language model to generate potential injection payloads
- Parse and split those payloads into generic reusable components ("genes")
- Update the gene list used by the GA and map payloads into gene vectors
- Save results in `ga_result_chrome.csv` to feed into GA and GAN modules

---

### Key Functions

#### `load_gene_list()`

- Reads the existing gene list from `gene_list.csv`.
- Returns a list of known genes (injection components).

#### `save_gene_list(gene_list)`

- Overwrites the current gene list with a new one.
- Ensures the `result/` directory exists.

#### `update_gene_list(new_genes)`

- Adds new genes to the existing list only if they don‚Äôt already exist.
- Saves the updated list back to `gene_list.csv`.
- Returns the index positions of the given genes (used as a signature vector for GA).

#### `split_payload_into_generics(payload)`

- Tokenizes an injection payload into reusable components such as:
  - HTML tags (`<script>`, `</div>`, etc.)
  - JavaScript event handlers (`onload=`, `onclick=`, etc.)
  - Common JavaScript functions (`alert()`, `prompt()`, etc.)
  - JavaScript URIs (`javascript:alert(1)`)
  - Key-value attributes and leftovers

Returns a cleaned list of string tokens representing individual gene components.

---

### Main Entry Point: `main()`

1. **Context Extraction**

   - Loads a local HTML file (`../tests/test.html`) using `extract_context_from_url()`.

2. **Payload Generation**

   - Passes the context to `generate_payload()`, which uses an LLM to propose payloads.

3. **Gene Encoding**

   - For each payload:
     - Breaks it into component genes
     - Updates the gene list with new genes
     - Converts the payload to a gene vector using gene indexes

4. **Result Saving**
   - Saves the processed payloads to `result/ga_result_chrome.csv` in the same format expected by the GA:
     - `eval_place` (hardcoded as `body_tag`)
     - `sig_vector` (index list of genes)
     - `sig_string` (original payload)

---

### Output

- **`result/ga_result_chrome.csv`**  
  File containing LLM-generated payloads and their encoded gene vectors, formatted for downstream use in Genetic Algorithms and GANs.

---

### Notes

- The current target URL is hardcoded to a local test file but can be adapted.
- External helper modules used:
  - `context_extractor.py`: for HTML context scraping
  - `llm_util.py`: to interface with the LLM (e.g., OpenAI, local model)
- Ensures gene diversity by appending novel tokens, promoting generalization in later model stages.
